There are a few steps that must be taken to make GPRobot work:
 # Config.java must be set such that it points to where Robocode is, and also a valid location to save the serialized file.
 # Robocode must be configured so that the "bin" directory containing the .class files is in the Preferences -> Developement Options section.
 # You'll also probably want to set Preferences -> View Options -> Desired TPS to 10000.
